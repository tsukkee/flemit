FLemit is a library that allows dynamic ABC (ActionScript Byte Code) code to be generated and executed at runtime. FLemit is NOT an ActionScript compiler; it requires users have a thorough knowledge of the AVM2.

FLemit currently only exists as the basis for [FLoxy](http://code.google.com/p/floxy/), the dynamic proxy generation library which, in turn, was created for [ASMock](http://asmock.sourceforge.net/). For that reason, it's APIs are not currently documented and will change dramatically in the future.
